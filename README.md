# Project Structure:

- `My project structure includes folders such as data, public, type, and pages. Besides, I also configured the  prettierrrc.json file and tailwind.config.ts file` 
  - The data directory contains mock data for the application when there are no corresponding APIs. 
  - The public folder contains images related to the application, and these images are svg files taken from Figma. 
  - The type routine will contain the type formats for the data folder because I use typescript for the application.
  - The page folder will contain the application's interfaces, and here I have a folder called the send-token interface.
